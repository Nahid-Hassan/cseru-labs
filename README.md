### Computer Science and Engineering Lab Solution - University of Rajshahi

In this repository I am trying to contribute my **3rd** year and **4th** year lab solutions with documentation. I am not guaranteed that all the code is **BUG** free. If you follow my code it is your responsibility 😴. 

Some of the resource links are added in the various `README.md` documentation files in different directories. I want to gives all of you very very special thanks. You all are awesome.
