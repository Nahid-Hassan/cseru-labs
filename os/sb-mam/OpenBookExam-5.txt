1. Imagine that you are an OS developer. In which way you would like to deal with deadlock? Why?
2. Write a C program to show that deadlock happens in two processes?
3. Say one process has two threads, T1 and T2, which are modifying a global variable.
   The main thread wait for T1 and T2 so that they can finish their tasks.
   T1 and T2 use mutex to syncronize their works. In which case, deadlock happens? Why?
          Case-1                                              Case-2
   -------------------------------------            -------------------------------------
        T1              T2                             T1                  T2
   mutex(lock)         mutex(lock)                  mutex(lock)         mutex(lock)
   critical section    critical section             critical section    critical section
   mutex(unlock)       mutex(unlock)                mutex(unlock)       mutex(unlock)
   
4. Draw a resource allocation graph and its corresponding graph using your own example.
   Do not include the examples available in the book or Internet.
