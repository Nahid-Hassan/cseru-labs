### Lab Experiment - 4

```
- Create a process, named Laltu, having three processes, named Ittu, Bittu, and Mittu .

- Laltu reads two variables 'a' and 'b' which all its child process know somehow.

- Ittu, Bittu, and Mittu  perform addition, subtraction and multiplication of
two variables read by Laltu and keep the output in a variable, 'Result'.

- Result will be seen and accessed by all processes. That means all processes will see the updated value of 'Result.

- All processes print their process ID, CPU Info, and values of 'a' and 'b' before performing their corresponding operation using separate printf instruction. Then they perform their operations which they are supposed to be done. Then each process will print 'Result'.

- Laltu will waits until Ittu, Bittu and Mittu finish their tasks.

- Take necessary steps to avoid inconsistency in 'Result'.
