Create a process, named Mellow, having two child processes named 'Pillow' and 'Killow'.
All processes show their PIDs & CPU information in an infinite loop.
Mellow shows also its own child processes PIDs. Check two cases:
        a) If Pillow and Killow are killed manually before Mellow.
        b) If Mellow is killed manually before Pillow and Killow.

Output can be:
$./Mellow
Process-4035, parent of Pillow-4036 and Killow-4037, running at CPU-0.
I am child-4036 running at CPU-7.
I am child-4037 running at CPU-10.
Process-4035, parent of Pillow-4036 and Killow-4037, running at CPU-0.
I am child-4036 running at CPU-7.
